    "\n",
    "Let's break down what happened here. The `open` function takes in two arguments: first, a filename, and second, the **mode**. The mode determines what Python does to the file. The three modes we're covering today are:\n",

    "1. `'w'` - **w**rite mode. This means Python is primed to _write_ to the specified filename.\n",

    "3. `'a'` - **a**ppend mode. This means Python is primed to _write_, but _will not overwrite file contents_ - it will instead append anything it's told to write at the bottom of the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the file we are interacting with using `open` is temporarily assigned to `f`. This means that for the duration of the indented code immediately afterwards (like in a for loop), `f` is an object with several special methods and attributes we can use to read/write to the file. Finally, we indent the next line and use the `.write` method, which takes in a string, to specify the text we want to write.\n",

Remember how when we used a method like `my_str.upper()`, we didn't provide any input to the parentheses?

Here, we save two attributes: the filename itself, and then the length of the filename, using the `len` function.
