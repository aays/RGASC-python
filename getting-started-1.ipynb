    "# Getting Started with Python - Part I\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1 of this introductory workshop is meant to familiarise you with some key concepts in Python programming. Specifically, this lesson will cover the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introduction to the Python interpreter and the Jupyter environment\n",
    "- Python object types (e.g., numeric, float, string, etc.)\n",
    "- Iteration (e.g., for loops) and conditional statements (e.g., if/else)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 The Python interpreter and the Jupyter environment\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to interact with Python. We can run lines of code one at a time into a prompt (using what is known as an _interpreter_) or write multiple lines into a _script_ that can then be run all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "A middle ground to these two options is offered by **Jupyter**, which is also what we'll be using today. Jupyter files, or _notebooks_, combine text with code, and allow us to run one or more lines of code at once while also writing associated text. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've opened Jupyter using the Anaconda Navigator, let's create a new Python notebook. This will bring up a blank page with a space to enter text at the top. This space is referred to as a _cell_, and is how code _or_ text can be entered into Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new code cell in Jupyter, we use the `+` icon on the top left of the screen. As soon as that button is pressed, a new cell will be created and the cursor will be ready to take in Python code. We can then write one or more lines of code in the cell before executing its contents with `Shift + Enter` or the Play icon on the toolbar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try it now with some simple math:"

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "We see that once this code cell is run, the output will appear right beneath it, and Jupyter will automatically create a new code cell underneath for us to continue typing into. We can always go back and click on a previous cell to modify it if we would like, or to simply re-run it for whatever reason with `Shift + Enter` once more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice also the `[1]` to the left of the cell. This number tracks the number of code cells that have been run in the notebook, in addition to the order in which they've been run. Since this was our first code cell, Jupyter displays `[1]` next to it. If we were to re-run the code cell, Jupyter would now display `[2]`. If you restart the notebook, this number will reset and the next code cell you run will once again display `[1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These cells can also be used to store text. To change a cell into a text cell instead of a code cell, use the dropdown menu at the top of the screen that says `Code` and instead select `Markdown`. Markdown is a simple means of styling plain text that allows for easy addition of headers and italicized/bold words using plain text characters. In Jupyter, once we've written the contents of a Markdown cell, pressing `Shift + Enter` will render the text as we've written it. Let's try typing the following into a Markdown cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is a sample Markdown cell. Here is some text in _italics_ and some text in **bold**.\n",

    "To go back and modify a Markdown cell after it's been rendered, simply double click on it. \n",

    "Finally, for the more shortcut-inclined folks, it may be useful to know that `Esc -> M -> Enter` (three separate keystrokes) will convert a cell to Markdown, while `Esc -> Y -> Enter` will convert a cell back to code. "
